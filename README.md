An online shop selling men's and womenâ€™s rain jackets, that are designed for a range of different outdoor activities that enrich people's lives. 

## Description

For my cross course project, I was tasked with creating and developing a dynamic e-commerce platform for a distinctive brand selling men's and women's rain jackets, designed for enhanced outdoor experiences. 

Working through variuous stages and timelines, the project required careful planning and newly-acquired knowledge implementation in areas such as:

- Designing a prototype
- Laying the initial coding foundation with HTML/CSS
- Using Postman to test API calls and retrieve JSON data
- Using an API call to fetch product details from WordPress
- Adding functionality with JavaScript

## Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript)
- [WordPress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
